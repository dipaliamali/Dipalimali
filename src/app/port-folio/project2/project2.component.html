<p>The details of the projects displayed on the websites of construction companies can be in process or accomplished. If we look at the start of all the projects that had begun either simultaneously or in some kind of sequence due to which the construction firm has had to analyse and optimize costs, resources, technologies by setting the priorities to projects in order to achieve optimal efficiency in financial and strategic goals of the organisation. This whole concept of analysing and managing a companyâ€™s project portfolio is called Project Portfolio Management.Project portfolio management is much different from project management that includes management of resources according to pre decided goals whereas portfolio management is more of a tactical preparation, obligation to continuously make the best use of allocation, prioritization and scheduling of resources across various projects of a construction firm. The aim of project portfolio management is to manage and benefit from the life cycle of initiatives, projects, investments and outcomes to achieve the overall goals and objectives related to different projects of a construction firm.</p>
